We do data science for non profit purposes! Current running projects include analyzing data related to the opioid crisis and homelessness.

Are you interested in data science? Every talent level is welcome.

Do you have a project you are excited about? Every data science project is welcome.

Join us to learn and use data science to help non-profits wrangle their data. As a meetup our goal is to get both non-profits and geeks (even wannabe geeks) in the same room looking at data. Together we will use the tools of data science to understand data better and build experience in a growing field.
